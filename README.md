This is a blackjack card game that takes user input to hit on a hand or hold their hand to get as close to 21 as possible. This game is played against the dealer (PC) to see which score is higher. For extra credit we use enums to create the array list for the deck of cards. I worked with Kennedi and Rafael for this project
